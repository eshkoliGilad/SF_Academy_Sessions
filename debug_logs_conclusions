General info:

packageName identifier: com.academy.demo 
Plugin: Flutter
SDK version: 6.14.0
devKey: m********************5
User’s device: SM-G925F with API level 24 in it
Target SDK of the App: API level 34
AppsFlyer ID: 1713700188153-5890351156603729657
GAID: 972fe00a-cd2d-495d-ab3e-5ae8908a471c
Battery level: 62


API usage:
Init was called (Referrers logic was being invoked)
updateUninstallToken was called with null or empty token.
anonymizeUser was called before starting the SDK since conversions API goes out with:" deviceTrackingDisabled":"true”
UDL is being used as we have a dlsdk.appsflyersdl.com API and we can see onDeepLinking being invoked, which is only for UDL.
DMA was used AFTER start was called with manual consent.

Exceptions:
Remote Control (cdn-config failed with SSL Exception, networking or server issues).
GCD returned with 404, RTA didn’t manage to find an attribution for this AppsFlyer ID.


General flow:
1. User is first being anonymized (Might be integration issue)
2. App developer tried to call updateUninstallToken with a null or empty token (Might be integration issue)
3. SDK was initiated and started (We could see Referrers logic being called)
4. We tried to resolve DDL using UDL but got no matching NOT_FOUND
5. We tried to get GCD data for this user but failed to do so (404)
6. 3 seconds after the SDK was started we see that a new in-app event was invoked and we also have DMA manual consent flag, which wasn’t available before.

The in-app event data is:
Name - af_purchase_test_event1
Values - af_price = 200.5 and af_revenue =140
